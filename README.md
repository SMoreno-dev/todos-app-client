# TODOs App

This is the client-side/frontend repo. You can find the server-side/backend repo [here](https://github.com/SMoreno-dev/todos-app-server).

This project integrates a React frontend with a Node.js backend through a REST API with a PostgreSQL database.

Features include:

- Creation and authentication of users, necessary to gain access tokens.
- Authorization of actions through json web tokens.
- A feed that lists all TODO entries.
- Creation and Deletion of TODOs

## Guide

### Setting up the database

Install [postgresql](https://www.postgresql.org/) locally. Then use the following command to check if the `psql` shell is working:

```
psql -U postgres
```

You won't need to create the database manually as long as you've got your environment variables set up properly.

### Setting up Node.js

Start by cloning the server-side repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/SMoreno-dev/todos-app-server
```

Then install:

1. [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

Next, `cd` to your project directory and run `npm install`

```
cd directory/server-side-project
npm install
```

You'll need to keep track of the environment variables. These are detailed in .env.example for your convenience.

```
app.listen(PORT, HOST, () => {
  console.log("Server running on port ", PORT);
});

```

Now you can simply run the server by using:

| Script  | Description                                                         |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `start` | Runs the app in production mode                                     |
| `dev`   | Drops and creates a dev database, and runs the server using nodemon |
| `test`  | Drops and creates a test database, and runs mocha tests             |

You should be able to access the server on http://[host]:[port]/

As for the client-side, you'll need to create a new directory, and clone the other repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/SMoreno-dev/todos-app-client
```

And again, `cd` to the project directory and run `npm install`:

```
cd directory/client-side-project
npm install
```

Finally, you can run the react app with the following command:

```
npm start
```

By default, this should run the react app in http://localhost:3000/. Make sure it doesn't match your back-end port.
